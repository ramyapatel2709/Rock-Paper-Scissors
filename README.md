# ✊ Rock Paper Scissors ✌️

A beginner-friendly Rock-Paper-Scissors game made using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project runs entirely in the browser—no frameworks, no libraries, just good ol' vanilla JS.

## 🎮 How It Works

- You and the computer face off in a **best-of-3** Rock-Paper-Scissors match.
- Click one of the big emoji buttons on the left to make your move.
- The computer randomly chooses its move on the right.
- After each round, there's a short delay and the game resets for the next move.
- At the end of 3 rounds, the final winner is displayed with a **"Play Again"** button.

## 🧠 Tech Used

- ✅ HTML5
- ✅ CSS3 (flexbox, animations, basic styling)
- ✅ JavaScript (vanilla, beginner-safe)
